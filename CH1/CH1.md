# Chapter 1 : Introduction 



**Here we will see two methods of pridiction** 


Scopee of computational science **1)** Heat and Mass Transfer **2)** Fluid Flow **3)** Chemical Reaction **4)** Petroleum Reservoir Simulation **5)** etc

**Need for understanding and prediction:** To find optimum soltion among a number of alternatives possibilities  

**`Predictions`** help us forecasting, controlling, and operating the equipments more safely and efficiently. 

Also, **`Predictions`** benefits us economicly  


- The prediction should state how any of quantities would change in response to proposed changes in geometery and operational conditions throughout the domian and interval of interest!!!

### Experimental Investigation

1. The most reliable infomation about physical process is often given by actual measurement.  
2. These tests are prohibitively expensive and often impossible.     
3. The measuring instruments are not free from errors.
